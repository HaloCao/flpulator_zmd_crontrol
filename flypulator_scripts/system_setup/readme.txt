The documentation of system setups and convenience scripts is a nicety to help new contributors and
to make recovery easy in case something gets messed up.

-> GroundPC.sh : With this script a user can install the required software on an Ubuntu PC. The
script can either be run with ./GroundPC.sh, or the user can look inside the script and copy out the
commands he/she would like to execute.
-> CompanionSetup.sh: This script handles the basic setup of the NUC companion computer. If a fresh
system is installed this script can be run to get back on track quickly.

TBD:
- convenient setup to connect Laptop and NUC.. routing
- convenient way to monitor the complete system ...
