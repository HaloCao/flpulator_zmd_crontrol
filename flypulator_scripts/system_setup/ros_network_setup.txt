The following setup was used to connect the local computer to the NUC:

(In this case roscore runs on the local computer, and the local computer is logged into the wifi
hotspot broadcasted by the flypulator)

What needs to be set up:
- the machines must be able to ping each other and themselves by name.
i.e on flypulator: ping flypulator works...
- the computer not running roscore must get the ROS_MASTER_URI exported
- The ROS_HOSTNAME must correspond to hostname so that they can ping each other.

The hostname can be set in /etc/hostname.



On the local computer:
add to the bashrc:
export ROS_HOSTNAME=<nameOfLocalPC>
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<nameOfLocalPC>:11311

add to /etc/hosts:
10.42.0.1 flypulator // check that the IP is correct.

On Flypulator:
add to the bashrc:
export ROS_HOSTNAME=flypulator
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<nameOfLocalPC>:11311


add to /etc/hosts:
IP-localPC <nameOfLocalPC>
